Yes, the two declarations you mentioned will obtain the same result. The int x{}; declaration will initialize the variable x to the default value of int, 
which is 0. The int x = 0; declaration will also initialize the variable x to the value 0.

The difference between the two declarations is that the int x{}; declaration is a uniform initialization declaration, while the int x = 0; 
declaration is an assignment declaration. Uniform initialization declarations are more concise and easier to read than assignment declarations. 
Additionally, uniform initialization declarations can help to prevent errors, because the compiler will ensure that the variable is initialized to the correct value.

In general, it is recommended to use uniform initialization declarations whenever possible. However, if you need to initialize the variable to
a specific value other than the default value, then you should use an assignment declaration.
