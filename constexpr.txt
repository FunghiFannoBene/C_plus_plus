Any variable that should not be modifiable after initialization and whose initializer is known at compile-time should be 
declared as constexpr. NOT COMPATIBLE WITH FUNCTIONS THEN!
Any variable that should not be modifiable after initialization and whose initializer is not known at compile-time 
should be declared as const.

Caveat: In the future we will discuss some types that are not currently compatible with constexpr 
(including std::string, std::vector, and other types that use dynamic memory allocation).
For constant objects of these types, use const instead.
