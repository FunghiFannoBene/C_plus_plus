std::cout

The iostream library contains a few predefined variables for us to use. 
One of the most useful is std::cout, which allows us to send data to the console to be printed as text. cout stands for â€œcharacter output"

#include <iostream> // for std::cout standard::character output

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!"; // print Hello world! to console

    return 0;
}
