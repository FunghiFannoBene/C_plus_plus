file.o is a binary file another program called the linker kicks in. The job of the linker is three fold:

First, to take all the object files generated by the compiler and combine them into a single executable program.

#Language Version

Setting a language standard in g++

For GCC/G++, you can pass compiler flags -std=c++11, -std=c++14, -std=c++17, or -std=c++20 to enable C++11/14/17/20 support respectively. If you have GCC 8 or 9, you’ll need to use -std=c++2a for C++20 support instead.

Setting a language standard for VS Code

For VS Code, you can use compiler flags "-std=c++11",, "-std=c++14",, "-std=c++17",, or "-std=c++20", to enable C++11/14/17/20 support respectively. If you have GCC 8 or 9, you’ll need to use "-std=c++2a", for C++20 support instead.

Place the appropriate language standard flag (including the double quotes and comma) in the tasks.json configuration file, in the "args" section, on its own line before "${file}".

For C++20, in settings.json, change or add the following setting on its own line: "C_Cpp.default.cppStandard": "c++20".
