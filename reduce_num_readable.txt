In scientific notation, this would be written as 5.9736 x 10²⁴ kg, which is much easier to read. 
Scientific notation has the added benefit of making it easier to compare the magnitude of two really 
large or really small numbers simply by comparing the exponent.

Because it can be hard to type or display exponents in C++, we use the letter ‘e’ (or sometimes ‘E’) 
to represent the “times 10 to the power of” part of the equation. For example, 1.2 x 10⁴ would be written as 1.2e4, 
and 5.9736 x 10²⁴ would be written as 5.9736e24.

For numbers smaller than 1, the exponent can be negative. The number 5e-2 is equivalent to 5 * 10⁻², which is 
5 / 10², or 0.05. The mass of an electron is 9.1093822e-31 kg.
