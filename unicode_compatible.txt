char16_t and char32_t were added to C++11 to provide explicit support for 16-bit and 32-bit Unicode characters. 
char8_t has been added in C++20. These char types have the same size as std::uint_least16_t, std::uint_least32_t, 
and std::uint_least8_t respectively (but are distinct types)

You won’t need to use char8_t, char16_t, or char32_t unless you’re planning on making your program Unicode compatible. 
Unicode and localization are generally outside the scope of these tutorials, so we won’t cover it further.

In the meantime, you should only use ASCII characters when working with characters (and strings). 
Using characters from other character sets may cause your characters to display incorrectly.
